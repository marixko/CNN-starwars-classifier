# Classifying images of Darth Vader, Stormtrooper, and Yoda

In this notebook, I explore some Computer Vision concepts in the context of Darth Vader/Stormtrooper/Yoda classification. I tested the classification performance of a Perceptron, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and two pre-trained Deep Learning architectures (MobileNetV2 and ResNet) for Transfer Learning. This is experimental and there are still plenty room for improvements :)
